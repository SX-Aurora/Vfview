## About

Vfview is the visualizer for Vftrace profile files `*.vfd`. You need to have Vftrace installed in order to generate these files, consult

https://github.com/SX-Aurora/Vftrace

for this purpose.

Vfview displays the time evolution of function stacks for each MPI rank. Other features include the visualization of hardware counters and the analysis of MPI communication, i.e. using a communication matrix.
